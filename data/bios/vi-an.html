  Professor Anigbogu believes that sound, value-based education is central to
  reconstructing the mindset of Africans and people of African descent towards
  integrity leadership and quality management skills required for the
  transformation of their organizations, communities, and nations.<br /><br />Towards
  this end, he founded the Institute for National Transformation (INT) in Lagos,
  Nigeria in September 2007 for which he serves as the Director General. The
  Institute focuses on developing “no excuse” leadership of integrity and
  exceptional organizational skills from both the private and public sectors.<br /><br />Such
  leaders should proffer performance instead of pronouncements, expertise and
  competence instead of title and position, pioneer bold and progressive
  initiatives instead of dictatorship and control; and leave lasting legacy in
  the continent instead of failures and excuses. INT has training centers in
  Nigeria, Uganda, Atlanta (USA). It also has presence in Rwanda, South Africa,
  Ivory Coast, and London (UK).<br /><br />He is married to Peggy for over 32
  years. They work and travel together world-wide as consultants to business
  establishments, State and National governments, Universities, and Church
  organizations. Professor Anigbogu admits: “I have an unquenchable passion for
  a new Africa and to see a fulfilled God’s vision for the people of African
  descent.”
