<div id="bio">
  David Bansié Flan was born and raised in Côte d'Ivoire. He married Gueu Ve
  Simone on February 11, 1989, in Man, Côte d'Ivoire. Together, they have been
  blessed with six children: three daughters and three sons.<br /><br />David's
  spiritual journey began with his conversion to Christianity on January 1,
  1983. He took a significant step in his faith by being baptized on July 17,
  1985, just two days after receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This
  marked the beginning of his deep commitment to his faith and ministry.<br /><br />In
  1990, while serving as a local youth leader and overseeing several church
  branches, David started having dreams in which the Lord called him to lead His
  people. Initially, he refused the call due to concerns about his mother, as he
  was an only son and felt responsible for her well-being. However, a prophetic
  message reassured him of the Lord's presence and guidance, convincing him to
  accept the call. Remarkably, his mother is still alive, a testament to the
  grace of the Lord.<br /><br />David pursued theological and pastoral training
  from October 3, 1998, to June 22, 2000, at Katadji. He then completed a
  practical internship from September 2, 2000, to June 30, 2001, at Riviera 2 in
  Abidjan Cocody under Dr. Adama Ouédraogo. Following this, he concluded his
  theological and pastoral education on June 22, 2002, earning his diploma.<br /><br />David's
  missionary journey began in Guinea, where he served from 2002 to 2004,
  focusing on church planting. From 2004 to 2015, he returned to Côte d'Ivoire
  to gain further ministerial experience. He then resumed his missionary work in
  Guinea from September 30, 2016, to September 6, 2024. As of September 6, 2024,
  David has returned to Côte d'Ivoire, where he continues his ministry.<br /><br />During
  his time in Guinea, David, by the grace of the Lord, established six places of
  worship. These include a 250-seat church in Wanidara, Conakry; a multi-story
  building in Siguiri with a 700-seat church and six additional rooms serving as
  offices and classrooms; a 260-seat church with a pastoral house in Nafadji; a
  300-seat church in Léro alongside an operational school since 2020, offering
  education from kindergarten to ninth grade; a small congregation in Niagassola
  that currently meets in the pastor's living room; and a 250-seat church in
  Kouremalé.<br /><br />Among the testimonies from his missionary work in
  Guinea, three previously barren women experienced the joy of childbirth.
  Additionally, several church members received significant job promotions,
  including Mr. Souomy Barnabas, who became the Director of Logistics at a
  Guinean mining company, and Mr. Alexis Toh Mamy, who advanced from a security
  guard to a supervisory position.<br /><br />David remains dedicated to his
  ministry, open to the guidance of the Holy Spirit for future missions, and
  continues to impact lives through his faith and leadership.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
