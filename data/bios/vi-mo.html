<div id="bio">
  <i>Apostle Victor Mokgotlhoa</i> was born again on the 3rd of October 1971
  while he was at a boarding school. He received a call to the ministry from the
  Lord in 1974, however, due to lack of spiritual mentoring and immaturity he
  never responded to the call, he rather deviated from this calling and got
  trained as a teacher. <br />During the first 5 years of &nbsp;his career, the
  call echoed even more. After working in the industry for 2 more years he
  decided to resign from teaching and followed the call. <br /><br />In 1984 he
  quit his secular jobs and shifted to Pastoring, and after undergoing the
  ministry training he started a church in the village. He then planted 4
  churchers after 2 years in the ministry. <br /><br />Apostle Victor has been a
  Senior Pastor at Praise Tabernacle Church in Johannesburg, South Africa and is
  a theology scholar. During his pastoring, he got involved in missionary work.
  This happened after he got exposed to mission work in South Korea. Now the
  Church is involved with mission work in Angola, Malawi, Botswana and Uganda.
  Teaching ministry is prevalent to these countries.<br /><br />He got married
  in 1985 to Salome Mokgotlhoa and they are blessed with 3 amazing children
  &nbsp;(2 boys and 1 girl).&nbsp;
