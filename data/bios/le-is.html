<div id="bio">
  Les Isaac is the Founder and President of Ascension Trust. He pioneered Street
  Pastors in the UK in<br />2003. On that first night, 18 volunteers took to the
  streets of Brixton, London, and since then this<br />initiative has grown to
  encompass a network of volunteers who engage with people on the streets to<br />care
  for them, listen to them and help them. To date, Ascension Trust has trained
  over 14,000<br />volunteers and has approximately 280 initiatives in the UK as
  well as projects in several countries<br />around the world.<br /><br />In
  recognition of the contribution that Les has made to society he was awarded an
  OBE by her<br />Majesty the Queen and has recently been appointed as an
  honorary Ecumenical Canon at Southwark<br />Cathedral.<br /><br />On 5th July
  2022 Les spoke at the National Parliamentary Prayer Breakfast. His sermon was
  the<br />catalyst for the resignation of multiple cabinet ministers and
  ultimately led to Boris Johnson stepping<br />down as Prime Minister.<br /><br />He
  is the author of three books, Dreadlocks, Street Pastors and Faith on the
  Streets.
