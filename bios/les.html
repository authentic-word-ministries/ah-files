<h2>Canon Les Isaac OBE</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Founder and President</strong><br />
  <strong>Ascension Trust</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Les Isaac is the Founder and President of Ascension Trust. He pioneered Street
  Pastors in the UK in 2003. On that first night, 18 volunteers took to the
  streets of Brixton, London, and since then this initiative has grown to
  encompass a network of volunteers who engage with people on the streets to
  care for them, listen to them and help them. To date, Ascension Trust has
  trained over 14,000 volunteers and has approximately 280 initiatives in the UK
  as well as projects in several countries around the world.
</p>
<p>
  In recognition of the contribution that Les has made to society he was awarded
  an OBE by her Majesty the Queen and has recently been appointed as an honorary
  Ecumenical Canon at Southwark Cathedral.
</p>
<p>
  On 5th July 2022 Les spoke at the National Parliamentary Prayer Breakfast. His
  sermon was the catalyst for the resignation of multiple cabinet ministers and
  ultimately led to Boris Johnson stepping down as Prime Minister.
</p>
<p>
  He is the author of three books, Dreadlocks, Street Pastors and Faith on the
  Streets.
